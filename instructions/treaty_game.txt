This is an experiment in decision making.
<br>
Your earnings depend on decisions you make as well as the decision of the Player you are paired with.
<br>
If you have questions at any time, please raise your hand and a monitor will come to help.

<ul>
<li>The experiment is composed of several <span class='font-weight-bold'>Matches.</li>
<li>Each Match has many <span class='font-weight-bold'>Periods.</li>
<li>You will earn <span class='font-weight-bold'>Income every Period. </span>All Income is placed into your <span class='font-weight-bold'>Bank Balance.</li>
<li>The more money in your final Bank Balance at the end of each Match, the more you will be paid in US Dollars.</li></ul>

<li>In this experiment, there are two types of Players: A and B. </li>
<li>You will be the same type for the entire experiment.</li>
<li>Each Match, Player A and Player B are paired up. You will be paired with a different person each Match.</li>


{% page Territory Income %}
{% header Territory Income %}
{% hide middle-panel %}

<li>In each Match, there is Territory.</li>
<li>You control some Territory. Territory not under your control is controlled by the Player you are paired with.</li>
<li>The more Territory you control, the higher your income.</li>


{% page Territory Expansion %}
{% header Territory Expansion %}
{% hide middle-panel %}

<ul>
<li>Each Period, you may spend from your Bank Balance to perform Expansion.</li>
<li>The more you spend, the higher your Expansion for the Period.</li>
<li>Territory changes depending on how much each Player Expands.</li></ul>

{% page Expansion Example %}
{% header Expansion Example %}
{% hide middle-panel %}

<ul>
<li>Suppose you control 40 Territory and perform 5 Expansion this Period.</li>
<li>Example 1: The other Player Expands by 2. Next Period, you will control 40 + (5 - 2) = 43 Territory.</li>
<li>Example 2: The other Player Expands by 5. Next Period, you will control 40 + (5 - 5) = 40 Territory.</li>
<li>Example 3: The other Player Expands by 8. Next Period, you will control 40 + (5 - 8) = 37 Territory.</li></ul>

{% page Treaties %}
{% header Treaties %}
{% hide middle-panel %}

<ul>
<li>Each Period, Player A may propose a Treaty, and Player B may accept, reject, or ignore the Treaty.</li>
<li>Treaties have parts: a proposed Territory split, and a Payment.</li>
<li>If Player B accepts a treaty, the territory is reallocated according to the Treaty terms, and Player A pays Player B the amount offered.</li>
<li>Players may not Expand the same Period the Treaty is accepted.</li>
<li>Either Player may Expand in future Periods.</li></ul>
